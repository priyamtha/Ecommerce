1. Navigating Folders

 navigated through the folders to arrive at the proper place on  computer where  wanted to start creating  project. This action is in regards to putting  work in a certain folder.
 
2. Creating Folders
 
   organized your project into distinct folders, such as one for the backend (server-side) and another for the frontend (user interface). This organizes  project and makes it simple to work on.
   
3. Initializing the Project
   
    began the configuration of  project by defining a special file that will keep track of key information about  project, such as its name, version, and the tools it will utilize. This file is akin to a "control center" for  project.
4. Setting Up the Frontend

   set up the frontend (the part of the app that users interact with) using a tool that quickly creates a basic structure for  project. This saves time and avoids starting from scratch.
5. Adding Features to the Frontend

    introduced a library (React Router) to facilitate navigation through  app, such as transitioning between various pages. This is critical to ensure that  app is user-friendly.
6. Opening the Project in an Editor

    opened the project in a text editor (such as VS Code) so that can now begin working on the actual code and developing  app.
7. Initializing Version Control

     began monitoring changes in the project with a system known as Git. This allows  to store versions of the project so you can revert errors or observe what have altered over time.
8. Linking to GitHub

    linked  project to a remote repository (an online storage on GitHub) so that  would be able to save  work online and make it accessible to other people if necessary.
